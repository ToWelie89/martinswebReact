                    This is a little web app that I made, used for analyzing an Instagram account. I wanted to see metrics and data based on the feed of an Instagram user, such as most commonly used hashtags, distribution between video and image uploads, filters used, most liked content, most discussed content etc etc.
                    This app will take an Instagram user name as an input and then look up data for that user by communicating with Instagram API. After everything is loaded it will provide the user with statistics, neatly presented with charts and pie diagrams, to the user who
                    can get some valuable insight about the user.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Unfortunately the app is no longer functioning. Instagram changed their policy on the API usage and made it very exclusive so that only certain people can have full API access, which basically makes this web app unusable. But you can still view the source code.
